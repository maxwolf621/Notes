## Entity   

### Strong Entity  

A strong entity set is an entity set that contains sufficient attributes to uniquely identify all its entities.  

For example  
> movie  

### Weak Entity   
You need more further information (other Entity) to identify this Entity   

In ER diagram, weak entity set is always present in total participation with the identifying relationship set.

For example

1. First, building number is required to identify the particular building.  
2. Secondly, door number of the apartment is required to uniquely identify the apartment.  


### Simple Attribute   
an Atomic values, which cannot be divided further.

For example
```vim   
Released  
Title  
MovieId  
```

### Composition Attribute   
  
`Attribute X = Attribute Y + Attribute Z`

```vim
Address  = Post Code + Sate  
```

### Key Attribute
Attribute with the uniqueness

```vim
MoveId
```  
  
### Multi-Valued Attribute  
Multi valued attributes are those attributes which can take more than one value for a given entity from an entity set.   

For example   
> Genres   

### Derived Attribute  

Derived attributes are those attributes which can be derived from other attribute(s).   
For example    
> Age can be derived from Genres    

## Relationship

So ...   
```diff
Student <-related with-> Course  
Teacher <-related with-> Course  
```
They can be presented as with the illustrator as the following

## Instance

Tuple/Instance/Record Inside A Schema   

## Build A ER Model

To Define the following ONE BY ONE   
1. **Create** Entities
2. The **Relationship** of Each Entity
3. The **Attributes** of Each Entity
4. The **(Primary)Key** of Each Entity
5. **Cardinality** BTW Each Entity


## Convert ER-Model into Table   

Tip : F.K (Duplicates) $\rightarrow$ P.K (Unique)
