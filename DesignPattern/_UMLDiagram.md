## Association and Dependency

Association : HAVE the object

Dependency : USE the object

[According to this Post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1230889/difference-between-association-and-dependency)   
- An association almost always implies that one object has the other object as a **field/property/attribute** (terminology differs).  
- **A dependency typically (but not always) implies that an object accepts another object as a method parameter, instantiates, or uses another object.** 

>>> A dependency is very much implied by an association.  

## Composition and Aggregation

**Composition and aggregation are two types of association** which is used to represent relationships between two classes.  

In Aggregation , **parent and child entity maintain `Has-A` relationship but both can also exist independently**. 

We can use parent and child entity independently. Any modification in the parent entity will not impact the child entity or vice versa.

In Composition, **parent owns child entity so child entity can't exist without parent entity**. We canâ€™t directly or independently access child entity.   
In the UML diagram, composition is denoted by a filled diamond.

Basic 
Composition(mixture) is a way to wrap simple objects or data types into a single unit   

 Aggregation(collection) differs from ordinary composition in that it does not imply ownership  

#### Life cycle   

**Composition's Children don't have their own life time (they are dependent on parent side)**   

Aggregation's Children can have their own life time   

#### Strong/Weak Association

- Composition is a strong association  
- Aggregation is a weak association   

## Realization Implementation vs Inheritance

Child `uses`/implements parent's methods

Child `has`/inherits parent's methods
