Annotations are means of attaching metadata to code

To apply a annotation 
```kotlin=
annotation class name(<PARAMATERS>)
```

`<PARAMATERS>` should be one of these only 
- Types that correspond to Java primitive types (Int, Long etc.)  
- Strings  
- Classes (Foo::class)  
- Enums  
- Other annotations  
- Arrays of the types listed above
